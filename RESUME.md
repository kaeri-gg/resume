### Summary

Results-driven Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of expertise in back-end and front-end web technologies, holding an MSc in Cybersecurity. Committed to continuous learning, I stay updated on emerging technologies and follow SOLID principles, emphasizing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure robust and reliable code. Well-versed in design patterns, I strive to build future-proof services.
Specializing in API development, I'm passionate about game development, particularly in browser-based games and 2D/3D renderings. Proficient in Typescript with React (R3F) or vanilla approaches for crafting engaging game experiences.
Diversifying my skills, I delve into microcontroller projects like Arduino. Guided by SOLID principles, I deliver high-quality, scalable, and maintainable solutions. Ready to bring my extensive experience and innovative mindset to dynamic projects, with a keen interest in gaming as a creative hobby.
