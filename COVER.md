I am writing to express my interest in the position of Remote Full Stack Developer. 

I finished my bachelor's program in 2016 in Tbilisi, Georgia with a degree as a software engineer. 
Then I moved to Estonia right away and pursued a Master's degree in Cyber-security at Tallinn university of technology and also at Tartu university which I completed in 2019.

I have strong knowledge of cyber-attacks and attack vectors, especially in web applications. 
I created Structured Query Language and Cross-site scripting attack scenarios for students. It was theoretical and practical scenarios where students were able to test their knowledge and acquire new skills in web application development and security. 
It was my Thesis topic for my Master's degree which I successfully defended in TalTech. The applications were built in PHP, Javascript, and assessment systems were developed in Python. 

I started programming when I was 17 and since then I am coding constantly and developing my skills. 
Since then I created a lot of websites, games for personal development. All my projects are on GitHub.

Currently, I am working in Rangeforce as a senior Full-stack developer. 
I have ownership of three projects there one is a legacy system written in Meteor.js and the rest are REST APIs written from scratch using Nest.js. 

I consider myself to be an enthusiastic person who performs my task to the highest standard within the given timescales. I always follow TDD.
I believe that my qualification will embark on this career and would make a valuable addition to your company.

Since I am self-motivated to create something awesome, I am constantly coding and developing my skills, I am so responsible, 
honest and reliable person and really enjoy delivering high quality, well-structured code to my customers - I could be the greatest candidate for your company.  
I am looking forward hearing from you.
